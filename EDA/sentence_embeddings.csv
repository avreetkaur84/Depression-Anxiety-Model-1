301,0,thank you mmm k im doing good thank you im from los angeles oh great i live in west los angeles the west side its alright i xxx no i live alone so i love it im from here so i grew up here its natural the weather um well the weather its always good its never its never bad uh um theres always something to do its rarely a dull moment the traffic the traffic is horrible well probably traffic is horrible in almost any major city but i hate the traffic not really i mean i have enough things going on here so if i travel its usually somewhere thats within driving distance i studied uh business i did no ive ive been done for a few years so i havent gone to school for a while one of these days ill go back to graduate school but my dream job would be to just work for myself and making lots of money um i dont know i dont really have a dream job just something that i can i can work under my own terms and get paid decently and and be in a creative creative environment um i dont know i think its just a matter of finding the right situation so right now eh its been people are a little conservative about what they want so and how they want it so its a little tougher than it seems se it should be but i dont know i think when the situations right i dont think its too difficult yep i work as an assistant as administrative assistant through a temp agency so its just basically i get sent out to do uh to do desk jobs um yes and no i mean i feel like i feel like i could do more but you know it works so you know yeah im pretty close i mean theyre around so um god really mad stupid people just basically doing just doing anything to annoy me um thats basically ba thats the big thing just just irritating stupid people laughter who just do things just to provoke provoke me for no reason at all um whats a good example just random people who who think its funny to just sit there and get a rise out of me just it doesnt have to be one any specific situation its just people who just think its funny to i think theyre just generally sadistic and they just think its its funny to to just prod you like its like poking a stick at an angry dog knowing that they know how to they just wanna push your buttons for no reason so uh god i dont remember i with those situations i usually try not to remember laughter when when it happens i just i just let it go and just like the past is the past i just tend not to look back what do you mean okay god what do i do to relax i like to run i like to go to the gym listen to music i have a lot of musician friends so i just so im usually around musicians so anything of that sort i like i like everything from punk rock art to tattoos to just anything thats thats generally art and creative whos been a positive pos i think its just friends in general who who seem to who seem to do well and i think they theyre very inspiring and which is sometimes a a bit tough in in a town like los angeles where i think everybodys on the go trying to accomplish their own goals so they dont its sometimes hard to find someone whos gonna be uplifting or try to be inspiring so i dont really have anybody in particular but people have kind of brought up things here and there you know just like hey instead of instead of doing this how about doing that or hey youre good at this why arent you doing that or something like that just you know im always looking for new opportunities so they always point out things that maybe i might i could do differently instead of just being negative saying hey dont do that thats no thats why are you doing that its a waste of time um i guess it depends on who you talk to im im okay at it i could probably work at that um i dont know i mean i can i i think i can do better at it well back to the point about people provoking me so i mean i try not to blow steam and let them get under my skin so i just usually try not to let it get to me but i dont know i guess with temper i guess it depends on how i handle my stress lately ive been better at it just because i think my situations been a little bit better no no no um nothing major i mean maybe when i was younger i couldve traveled more or i couldve worked towards something that paid better jobwise but i mean those are all things that i think at any point in life you always think like well i coulda shoulda wouldve done but you know but then again i think thats natural for anybody i mean i could i couldve become a banker or i couldve become a lawyer or a doctor and made about ten times the money that i make now but but then again i dont like the law and i dont like medicine so so im it wasnt meant to be so yeah so um i think i think my in my life i knew that i theres a lot of things i have ha theres more dislikes laughter than likes so i kinda narrowed it down to what am i good at and what am i not good at and what am i gonna work well or who who am i gonna work well with and who will i not work well with so i kind of i kinda sorted out and then the list kind of mmm kind of answered itself so no it i dont think it was hard but it was just but i think it was a real reality check and i think it its kind of a good thing cause sometimes trying to conform to doing things that doesnt really fit you doesnt make sense its like trying to shove a a round peg into a square a square hole and its like it just no matter how you try to shove it in its not gonna go in so sometimes its just might as well go down a path that seems to work better for you memorable experiences um hmm i think its just i dont really have like any one in particular i think i think every day is almost like a memorable experience whether its positive or negative i think its just everything from getting it just just the fact that i got a job and i can i can take care of myself is already almost like a memorable experience maybe for the average person it it sounds stupid but you know i think just the fact that im able im able to get this far in life without like completely selfdestructing is already an accomplishment so i feel like ive gotten somewhere maybe not to not maybe not to the point to the average person they might think like well why arent you a millionaire but you know what not everybody can be a millionaire yeah um when was the last time i really felt happy um i dont know im not really someone whos like i dont have any real high highs or low lows i mean i havent hit any lows so i mean i i dont know im usually pretty i feel like im a level person and im pretty happy ha every day i feel like if i accomplish one thing then im pretty happy so i guess to answer the question probably mmm probably yesterday i just feel like if i if im able to accomplish something then then hey im happy i dont know i dont really have a best

303,0,okay how bout yourself here in california yeah oh well that its big and broad theres a lot to do a lot of um um job opportunities than other states um pretty much that its big and theres a lot you can do here traffic um maybe the violence rate bad news even though you know you wanna know whats going on in your environment but you still have to watch it so you can you know look out to see whats going on on a daily basis sociology i have a um two year degree in liberal arts but my major was sociology no im actually an mta bus operator well since metro is steady growing um my dream job is to move up in the company and im about to actually start some classes for supervisory next week so um cause they look to promote within the company so thats the good thing theres a lot of opportunities at metro where you can take classes and theyll pay for your tuition and things of that nature thanks well its not actually hard as right now its easy if you take advantage of it right now cause they look to promote within so you know so since im already working there thats a good thing so its good to go ahead and take the classes that you need that youre interested in and go ahead and move up the ladder as soon as possible what do you mean im sorry okay read take a long walk hot bath meditate just close my eyes sometimes im pretty much good because see by me being a bus operator you run into circumstances and situations you gotta remain calm and still remain professional at the same time well i look at it like it it goes with i mean it comes with experience you know um you do something on a continuous basis usually you some somewhere down the line you become good at it you know so i i look at it like that so ive been driving for years and dealing with the public so its just how you handle circumstances you you know treat people like you wanna be treated no im pretty good at it now maybe when i was younger you know you as you get older you get wiser you learn different things and im still learning today i would say my family you know my kids you know even though you know i had been having a lot of deaths around me but thats just go thats part of the life experience you know you born here but you gotta leave here one day but my kids will keep me you know sane and you know i love them and my family thank you no laughter um setting good examples you know because youre the first teacher you know and you wanna set a positive good example for your kids and i think thats a good thing and it starts at home well um by you being the first teacher your kids youre youre their one that they see on a daily basis when they wake up so whatevers been taught in the home they lookin and learning every day you know whether its a home school you know people kids have a tendency to do things what they see you know what i mean so you try to keep it positive teach em good morals and values and how to get along with other people regardless of race and you know different things of that nature i have a um four and a half year old son i have a seven year old daughter and i also have a twenty three year old yeah im bout to be well my daughters pregnant with a boy she has three um little girls so i have three grandkids and um one on the way which is a boy this time yeah thank you the hardest thing is well right now im a single parent so that makes it hard alone itself you know and they can be expensive at times you know it depends on the persons situation you know the whether they have help or a job you know things of that nature to help the situation better but its hard you know but you i try to you know keep a job keep food in the house you know just maintain and support my kids the best way i can with my kids or just period whats memorable for me is that im the only one in my family with a degree so its kinda like yeah its kinda even though im the baby of ten kids you know and ive always kept that in the back of my mind even though everybody well pretty much my whole family have decent job but im the only one with a degree so i kinda like gave myself a pat on the back like you know you know i just thats the only thing i remember graduating you know and my family there and to support me thank you happy that i accomplished something you know just even though it may not be much but it was better than just have having a high school diploma and i had um i was working on my bachelors degree but i ended up in a bad car accident i never went back i got distracted and you know i was working at the same time but i was just like moreso i needed income than than um schooling at that time because i was a young parent you know cause i had my daughter at seventeen so i was like i needed the money to support her but i never went back but i feel like its never too late so i feel like ill take some classes now that im with metro to help me move up the ladder so thats why im starting a class next week thank you hm well the advice i wouldve gave myself that i probably wouldnt have been a young mother at a young age and that i probably wouldve stayed in school you know not let the accident just distract me and not i wouldve remained in school i probably wouldnt have had kids early you know um rather i probably wouldve stayed in school and probably have a part time job or something just i just feel like um education is a excellent thing for a person just having knowledge and learning different things keeping your mind open to learning new ideas every day so i think thats a plus you know in anybodys shoes just to better they selves you know through education maybe to um maybe promote within your company or whatever the case may be that they help better your career im not quite sure um you learn from your mistakes you know but at the same time you dont continue to make the same ones i feel like its okay to make a mistake but long as you do something to change you know um like myself even though im going to school late but still im going you know i wanna better myself career wise so yes my oldest daughter we had a argument because just the life that shes living right now and the things that shes going through and um i had told her that she just needed to make some changes to better her situation and uh we got into an argument because you know how your kids sometimes dont wanna hear it you know hear the stuff that youre saying even though its true or or they just you know well they just dont wanna hear it you know they may be going through something they dont wanna hear but we got into a argument about it but that just happened you know i just told her im not im sorry very close very close its just that the the situation my daughters in she just needs to make some changes to better her her life and ill be telling shes um shes kinda like stubborn in her own way you know i was raised to listen to your mom you know your moms not gonna tell you nothing wrong and ive been telling her over the years you know different things and its its kinda like i was talking to a wall because she she did the opposite and now shes she regretting it you know cause shes like my mom told me this you know mom im doing the opposite so i guess she gotta bump her head a couple of times to get it its kinda like i done told you i done left it alone and now its up to you to make the change its very frustrating because its like im talking to a wall and shes not hearing me and im like it seem like its taking forever for her to change but its left up to the individual whenever theyre ready you know what i mean once the person get tired of something theyll make it change it may not be when you want it to happen but the ball is her court you know i only can do so much oh wow i have my days um since i have two little ones um i kinda like trained them to go to bed at eight o clock because you know they gotta go to school and i think its important to have a good nights rest because it kinda like clears throat it it kinda like gets you ready for the next day or you know how you gonna feel if you rested what type of person youll be that day you know cause everybody have they days whether theyre good or bad but thats just a part of life and i feel like if you had a good nights good good nights rest hopefully youll have a good day you know pretty much you know i need my rest because im out there driving that bus and dealing with all these people and you know the job itself if very stressful so i feel like if im rested itll help me what am i like irritated tired um lazy you know feel like i wanna lay down probably go to sleep laughter get the rest that i need but laughter i never thought about that i just you know cause like i said you know everybody have their moments they do i never thought about that hm no no i dont really have a best friend but a person that i deal with and i used to work with um she would probably tell you that im very um outgoing a go getter dependable responsible im a um people person i get along with others you know im kinda like um i leave a good a a good mark whether i know you or not if you was to you know like like you and i now you know i um youd probably say oh she seems like a nice young lady or whatever you know something like that thank you well i try to stay happy id rather be happy than sad my kids keep me going

304,0,im doing good um from los angeles california um the cool weather the beaches the people the schools um child development yes to be a teacher for special education its not hard cause i love to work with children yes dishonesty maybe um like if a guy like especially when it comes to relationships when they lie to you about something thats very minimal my mom i wanna say my mom um very close we talk every day very close even though i dont live with them i try to see them as much as i can uh its okay laughter its its good its yes i do um theyre theyre friendly its just that theyre very quiet cause im not used to that environment its fine like the how much it costs is very cheap so thats good and theyre friendly so its fine i just wish it was a little bit it couldve been better so yeah yes laughter um i had a different option to live with somebody else and im still friends with the female and comes to find out that we connect more than the roommates that i live with so i kinda regret moving in with the roommates i have now versus who i was supposed to move with in the beginning so but im stuck for a year so its whatever thats fine how do i know who i yeah laughter theres nothing that really gets me really mad that i can think of the top of my head um um maybe when it comes to schools how they treat the children especially children of color maybe that really gets me mad mm yes because i do things from within i guess so um internally motivated to do things i guess yeah yeah wow i hardly ever argue with somebody laughter yeah oh my sister i guess my sister that was about a month ago uh i felt very betrayed and belittled because shes my little sister and she shouldnt be disrespecting me in any type of way because im an adult so yeah i was not feeling the situation at all um just her getting into grown folks business and it was a conversation between me and my mother and i guess she overheard what was being said and she felt like through my actions that i was choosing somebody else over my family when that wasnt even the case but because she didnt know the whole situation she just automatically assumed and put stuff on facebook about me disrespecting me calling me out by name and it was just yeah so laughter and she then comes to me about it like she did all this other stuff on facebook i dont thats one thing i dont like either is when you i hate indirect comments like if you have if you need to talk to me come directly to me dont put it on facebook tell other people thats a pet peeve of mine so i really dont like that yeah so but i mean were fine now so thats good yeah to not believe people so easily so gullible to not be so gullible i guess ive been hearing that lately how i believe anybody anything that somebody says without really thinking about it or without having them prove it so i guess you could say i let i made a lot of mistakes i dont wanna say i regretted it because im glad i went through it while i was younger than me getting older and going through the same situations so um yeah i believe people too easily and i give people too much chances so yeah when i went on a cruise which was a happy experience when i went on a cruise to mexico with my family um when i was sixteen about six years ago yeah laughter yeah i mean yeah i guess it was laughter no i really want to though um trying new things seeing new views of the world um trying the different type of foods um seeing how the government is and how they run the things out there i guess um yeah i plan to go to the bahamas next year i plan to do a lot of traveling next year actually so yeah its pretty good eh somewhat im tired laughter and i kind of fall asleep during class and whatnot yeah its my fault though um probably today

305,0,im doing alright uh originally im from california uh born in glendale im not too happy with it uh just unemployed at the moment but uh actively seeking uh uh doing what im supposed to be doing uh there are some uh some prospects there but hopefully ill learn something today yeah well i have one its a girlfriend so i consider her a roommate a lover type thing pardon me um were pretty close uh i met her last year and uh weve been through some troubling times but uh were starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel uh the troubling times uh i would let me see uh well i had uh gotten a dui last year and uh lost my job im a truck driver by trade so uh that kinda threw me way off uh having a fourteen hundred dollar a week job uh and then going to nothing kinda like plus losing my my license kinda really threw me off and uh i couldnt um i havent really uh found anything that i was interested in uh so i started cooking and our trying to see which other route i can go as far as uh having some kind of a career and uh so im choose choosing to go into the culinary field but you know uh meanwhile i still have to work its hard to find work with uh without going to school and uh so but i think today uh i applied at ralphs so hopefully ill get that job i should have that job actually so um but im starting to see a light like i said at the end of the tunnel now a little by little my dream job would be probably forestry service out in the wilderness yeah i like being alone pardon me well you know i have a a lot of for animals im an exotic animal trainer by trade and uh so and i like being i dont like people too much uh so being outdoors and uh ive always enjoyed being outdoors thats how i like being a truck driver ive traveled the world i dont necessarily like being in a warehouse or an office im of a a outdoors type of guy so uh one of my trips would be uh i spent a year and a half in japan and uh on the uh lower island uh there that uh they built that bridge uh the largest bridge in the world uh and uh i went there to work for uh for an all white oh uh an all white tiger act and uh working for a japanese circus so it was interesting that a lot of people on that island hadnt really seen a lot of americans cause that was also one of the islands that we uh that they bombed so there was a lot of negativity but i i pretty have a good idea out you know outlook uh on life uh especially during those times you know i i enjoyed myself you know through all the traveling and and meeting new people and um eating you know different um diverse foods and uh it was a good experience for me all of that whole experience was pretty good for me you know just traveling around with circuses and uh you know its been great uh probably um one some of the things i like about la theres not a lot that i like about la but um i like hollywood i like the the the movie industry um the uh huge uh um different different people you know different uh different ethnics of uh people here you know uh i enjoy talking to uh few you know a lot of foreigners you know i like to see where they came from and and what what its like there traffics atrocious you know traffic laughter uh ignorance uh being disrespected uh being disrespectful or whatever you know other people being disrespectful toward you or other people um thats about it dishonesty pardon me uh it happens on a daily basis it seems like you know i ride the bus a lot so uh you know or i if im riding my bike uh people tend to almost run me over so if im not totally paying attention to traffic uh you know i find myself sometimes you know having to wait to see what theyre gonna do instead of i having the right of way or uh something like that yeah big time what do i do when im annoyed um probably sit there and uh sit there and vent you know uh speak my mind even though a lot of times its im myself you know just like you know assholes or whatever you um well you know i carry rocks in my back pocket so i can it you know it happens so much where i i just it just amazes me at what people will do sometimes you know you almost get run over all you know i i probably almost get run over probably on a daily basis and if i wasnt paying attention id be up shit creek uh its hard with dealing with people especially trying not to react cause theres consequences for your reactions um it was with my girlfriend and uh it was about being honest uh um im pretty honest with im open and honest about any anything and everything and uh what it was about was uh just her lying to me uh telling me that she had told our landlord something and and that she had done something and that and that aspect and i come to find out a week later that it was a total lie so i just you know didnt like that at all pardon me um im trying to im missing the word for it uh just that i dont know now that whether i could believe anything she says now so it was it was uh i felt hurt you know uh that you know here we had been in a relationship for a little bit and well thats probably one of my biggest uh pet peeves is is being honest um i dont like i said i dont hold back and im pretty honest in anything and everything that i do or say so you know and if youre lying about something well you just youre always having to cover up uh more lies with the lies that that you already told and i just dont see any you know so it kinda took a lot from uh me trusting her now or you know whatever now im i you know is it truthful is it not you know so its kinda hurt our relationship cant do nothing about it uh fun i like going to the beach uh i love shooting darts but i havent done it in a while i i love i love to paint uh i got into watercolor painting and im pretty gifted at that and um uh i wanna try some other mediums and uh lets see here i love fishing uh havent gone in a while though and uh i like driving a truck you know uh its you know my job you know i was a i really really enjoyed it i dont like driving through cities but uh usually when im in the middle of the night where i can see all the stars i like star gazing ill see if i can um pick out some of those uh astronomy uh stars up up there and um im a pretty easy going guy so shooting pool um sunshine just those i like uh most memorable experiences um good or bad uh most memorable experiences uh probably uh playing with lions and tigers uh uh wrestling a a baby elephant in a in a mud puddle uh uh just enjoying myself i know not uh i dont have much family as it is uh at least here in the states i dont my moms from central america so uh but im not close to i have uh three brothers one sister and im probably not really really close to none of my siblings i speak with one brother uh quite a bit um my other youngest brother you know he he just id just rather not you know i converse con converse with him but its you know just i try to keep it on a professional basis my sister i dont talk to at all my my other brother underneath me i havent spoken to him in years so im just close with my mom uh my niece some of my nephews and thats about it have i done anything to avoid it um to avoid them uh yeah i just dont talk to them i dont call them i dont ask about them i you know i talk to my mom quite a bit my brother quite a bit but i just dont bring up those subjects or if they are brought up i just usually say you know thats on them and i really dont wanna deal with them so um its been hard lately its been probably hard for the last uh going on a year um you know i uh depends on my thought process at the time i like i said ive been looking for work quite a bit um so just wondering why you know i dont get called i i just have my i have racing thoughts so or i get depressed you know cause i or i worry about things that you know that really i have no control over so i dont lately i just been sleeping a bit too much uh at least for me because im so used to just sleeping four to five hours a a a night but now its changed to about eight to nine hours and im still tired uh lately i have been probably about the last few months um tired laughter um i you know if i dont sleep well sometimes then i just dwell back on the same things that have been bothering me so you know im more of a guy you know i love to work um and if im not then its just a little bit too much time for me to spend in my own head and so you know um i there i either if im busy or im doing what i you know in whatever job i do i kinda you know get to it i enjoy it uh its something new for me and uh so i can think about you know either work or i think of home and then think about this you know i dont have to worry about you know um money um you know bills are getting paid and i can just concentrate on other things either you know do the things i like or mm you know maybe spending a little bit more time with my girlfriend or you know so something like that how do i what how do i cope with them um i just try not to think about it uh its its not about whether coping with it or not um i just do its uh im more of a guy that just you know it may take me a moment to to um say that im coping with something but you know it its if i have no control over it theres nothing that i can really do about it the only thing i can do is control to do what im doing and thats actively looking for work uh actively going out on uh interviews uh talking with others about work so that i can just kinda you know get back to um back to basics you know i just dont let a lot of stuff bother me it does bother me but i try not to to let it continue to bother me if what has gotten me in trouble my mood swing i mean um yeah money i mean you know my past i i got a past history so uh which kinda tends to uh uh bother my uh my hiring process i dont know if im gonna get hired so i gotta deal with uh different different type of employers who are uh say uh felony friendly and uh uh stuff like that and i try you know i ive taken classes on uh on uh how to interview how to uh how to answer some of the questions which you know come up quite a bit and uh i kinda reflect back on that but i just uh i gotta keep putting to my head that thats not who who i wanna be anymore so or you know i ive done uh ive done uh ive done my time uh so to say but uh i took the time you know the last time i just took a lot of time and and try to uh work on the issues that were bothering me so um you know toward positive stuff i got my ged different things a lot of classes um uh thought about going to school i didnt go to school and uh anything that would kinda um change my old ways and and uh and try to move on to more productive activities pardon me i still didnt hear you that people have been deceitful can you repeat that one more time alright uh ive been diagnosed with uh bipolarism um its tough if you dont you know um i dont medicate so i mean i have been on medication before in the past but sniff um again its i try to live on life uh i try to live life on lifes terms and i just you know um i know the medical establishments always wanna label something and and what i dont like about it is that they just experiment with pills you know ive been on probably every imaginable pill that there is for that and um you know some of them have been too strong or some of them not strong enough and so i just try to cope with things uh um its just my life skills you know i i dont i dont wanna be using drug i know certain drugs work for like three to four months six months and then they go well here im gonna try you on this and or im gonna try you on that and its just an ongoing process and i probably for about the last two years actually about three years i kinda just said you know what thats it and um whether its different than whether if i would be on on on uhon meds for it um i dont think so you know its the still the same stuff i still get the same problems and i still uh get the same anxiety as if i if i was on medication for it or not so i just and ill deal with it you know sometimes its not good you know i get irritated at people a lot i dont like people um i dont like crowds i dont you know like obnoxious people huge empty quiet so um but i i get a person you know i its not that personality but i think people can see me and just say uh dont mess with this guy or you know um but still you know i like i i ride public transportation quite a bit and um you know you just get a lot of loud obnoxious people on there sometimes i gotta get off the bus thats how i deal with with with with people because i just know theres consequences if i if i didnt deal with it that way so i just let it go id rather take the time on getting off the bus waiting for the next bus and hopefully its not that bad did i have a problem before i got out uh well i i dont know if i knew that i had a problem um uh before i found out the thing is that i know other people um i have a lot of ups and downs so i know a lot in my younger days people would tell me you know when i told them that i was diagnosed with you know bipolar that um a lot of remarks were like oh thats whats wrong you know thats what was wrong with you we we wish that you wouldve wouldve found that out years ago uh and uh like i dont think the meds really work but what i do uh i think uh time kinda like you know just getting older kind of uh you know makes it work you know me me dealing with life so pardon me uh i talked to a therapist probably on a weekly basis for a while uh recently and uh it helps a lot you know uh just to get out my anger uh my thoughts um a lot of people may not understand that but uh a therapist is i think the bigger thing is that i can just get it all out uh whatevers bothing me whether it be uh people you know uh uh other issues you know were whatever the case may be i just think talking about it and theyre such good listeners and can kinda like you know they they give me the same advice that you know that i you know give myself or whatever that i would give to others uh but its always helpful if you hear it from somebody else somebody who will be has a you know are are you know they go to school for this so you know but its good to have yeah well i dont go anymore uh so um i kinda miss it you know like i said uh uh i miss it a lot actually but uh its just one of those things you know i just deal with it you know uh according to you know if i ever get a chance to go to therapy again i probably will um well monetary reasons and uh you know uh i dont have health insurance theres a lot of things that you know id like to do but i cant you know um you know money situations not that great right now so how does my friends describe me um they would probably describe me as uh uh energetic uh outgoing person uh once i get to know people um laughs i you know i laugh a i laugh a lot um but uh they would probably tell you that im also very serious and uh uh hidden person i dont reveal a lot you know and uh so someone who has been a positive influence in my life someone whos been um someone whos been a positive influence in my life uh probably my boss one of my bosses uh when i first started with uh with exotic animals he was real you know he was uh uh german and um they didnt teach i dont know what he saw in me but he taught me a lot about working with exotic animals and um showed a lot of confidence

that lasts for a long time like i get depressed and it last for months on end yeah uh to be honest i dont know i think its more about like you focusing on yourself and like i dont know i dont know how to explain that its like you have to figure out things within yourself you dont need someone else to talk to well originally when i went to a therapist i was court ordered now i wanna go to therapy for my anger management though i dont know what the fuck laughter i mean my wife left like three weeks ago so yes laughter uh its probably the hardest thing ive ever done so yeah well considering im

wife laughter yes many many things every day d every day well i couldve not broken stuff and i couldve uh stopped uh like i was basically blocking out the external universe and i was putting everything into myself and like focusing on other things so that i dont focus on the real life i was basically escaping and so in that sense i wasnt paying attention to her and thats basically why she left i mean that and being angry cause like both contributed their own proportion their own portion earlier today uh i mean i feel really happy all the time and then it just like goes away its like back and forth like one day ill one second ill be really happy and then another second ill be really sad cause ill think about something again and its like i gotta keep my mind off of things and like
