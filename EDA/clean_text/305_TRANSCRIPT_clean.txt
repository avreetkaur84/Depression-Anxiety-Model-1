im doing alright uh originally im from california uh born in glendale im not too happy with it uh just unemployed at the moment but uh actively seeking uh uh doing what im supposed to be doing uh there are some uh some prospects there but hopefully ill learn something today yeah well i have one its a girlfriend so i consider her a roommate a lover type thing pardon me um were pretty close uh i met her last year and uh weve been through some troubling times but uh were starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel uh the troubling times uh i would let me see uh well i had uh gotten a dui last year and uh lost my job im a truck driver by trade so uh that kinda threw me way off uh having a fourteen hundred dollar a week job uh and then going to nothing kinda like plus losing my my license kinda really threw me off and uh i couldnt um i havent really uh found anything that i was interested in uh so i started cooking and our trying to see which other route i can go as far as uh having some kind of a career and uh so im choose choosing to go into the culinary field but you know uh meanwhile i still have to work its hard to find work with uh without going to school and uh so but i think today uh i applied at ralphs so hopefully ill get that job i should have that job actually so um but im starting to see a light like i said at the end of the tunnel now a little by little my dream job would be probably forestry service out in the wilderness yeah i like being alone pardon me well you know i have a a lot of for animals im an exotic animal trainer by trade and uh so and i like being i dont like people too much uh so being outdoors and uh ive always enjoyed being outdoors thats how i like being a truck driver ive traveled the world i dont necessarily like being in a warehouse or an office im of a a outdoors type of guy so uh one of my trips would be uh i spent a year and a half in japan and uh on the uh lower island uh there that uh they built that bridge uh the largest bridge in the world uh and uh i went there to work for uh for an all white oh uh an all white tiger act and uh working for a japanese circus so it was interesting that a lot of people on that island hadnt really seen a lot of americans cause that was also one of the islands that we uh that they bombed so there was a lot of negativity but i i pretty have a good idea out you know outlook uh on life uh especially during those times you know i i enjoyed myself you know through all the traveling and and meeting new people and um eating you know different um diverse foods and uh it was a good experience for me all of that whole experience was pretty good for me you know just traveling around with circuses and uh you know its been great uh probably um one some of the things i like about la theres not a lot that i like about la but um i like hollywood i like the the the movie industry um the uh huge uh um different different people you know different uh different ethnics of uh people here you know uh i enjoy talking to uh few you know a lot of foreigners you know i like to see where they came from and and what what its like there traffics atrocious you know traffic laughter uh ignorance uh being disrespected uh being disrespectful or whatever you know other people being disrespectful toward you or other people um thats about it dishonesty pardon me uh it happens on a daily basis it seems like you know i ride the bus a lot so uh you know or i if im riding my bike uh people tend to almost run me over so if im not totally paying attention to traffic uh you know i find myself sometimes you know having to wait to see what theyre gonna do instead of i having the right of way or uh something like that yeah big time what do i do when im annoyed um probably sit there and uh sit there and vent you know uh speak my mind even though a lot of times its im myself you know just like you know assholes or whatever you um well you know i carry rocks in my back pocket so i can it you know it happens so much where i i just it just amazes me at what people will do sometimes you know you almost get run over all you know i i probably almost get run over probably on a daily basis and if i wasnt paying attention id be up shit creek uh its hard with dealing with people especially trying not to react cause theres consequences for your reactions um it was with my girlfriend and uh it was about being honest uh um im pretty honest with im open and honest about any anything and everything and uh what it was about was uh just her lying to me uh telling me that she had told our landlord something and and that she had done something and that and that aspect and i come to find out a week later that it was a total lie so i just you know didnt like that at all pardon me um im trying to im missing the word for it uh just that i dont know now that whether i could believe anything she says now so it was it was uh i felt hurt you know uh that you know here we had been in a relationship for a little bit and well thats probably one of my biggest uh pet peeves is is being honest um i dont like i said i dont hold back and im pretty honest in anything and everything that i do or say so you know and if youre lying about something well you just youre always having to cover up uh more lies with the lies that that you already told and i just dont see any you know so it kinda took a lot from uh me trusting her now or you know whatever now im i you know is it truthful is it not you know so its kinda hurt our relationship cant do nothing about it uh fun i like going to the beach uh i love shooting darts but i havent done it in a while i i love i love to paint uh i got into watercolor painting and im pretty gifted at that and um uh i wanna try some other mediums and uh lets see here i love fishing uh havent gone in a while though and uh i like driving a truck you know uh its you know my job you know i was a i really really enjoyed it i dont like driving through cities but uh usually when im in the middle of the night where i can see all the stars i like star gazing ill see if i can um pick out some of those uh astronomy uh stars up up there and um im a pretty easy going guy so shooting pool um sunshine just those i like uh most memorable experiences um good or bad uh most memorable experiences uh probably uh playing with lions and tigers uh uh wrestling a a baby elephant in a in a mud puddle uh uh just enjoying myself i know not uh i dont have much family as it is uh at least here in the states i dont my moms from central america so uh but im not close to i have uh three brothers one sister and im probably not really really close to none of my siblings i speak with one brother uh quite a bit um my other youngest brother you know he he just id just rather not you know i converse con converse with him but its you know just i try to keep it on a professional basis my sister i dont talk to at all my my other brother underneath me i havent spoken to him in years so im just close with my mom uh my niece some of my nephews and thats about it have i done anything to avoid it um to avoid them uh yeah i just dont talk to them i dont call them i dont ask about them i you know i talk to my mom quite a bit my brother quite a bit but i just dont bring up those subjects or if they are brought up i just usually say you know thats on them and i really dont wanna deal with them so um its been hard lately its been probably hard for the last uh going on a year um you know i uh depends on my thought process at the time i like i said ive been looking for work quite a bit um so just wondering why you know i dont get called i i just have my i have racing thoughts so or i get depressed you know cause i or i worry about things that you know that really i have no control over so i dont lately i just been sleeping a bit too much uh at least for me because im so used to just sleeping four to five hours a a a night but now its changed to about eight to nine hours and im still tired uh lately i have been probably about the last few months um tired laughter um i you know if i dont sleep well sometimes then i just dwell back on the same things that have been bothering me so you know im more of a guy you know i love to work um and if im not then its just a little bit too much time for me to spend in my own head and so you know um i there i either if im busy or im doing what i you know in whatever job i do i kinda you know get to it i enjoy it uh its something new for me and uh so i can think about you know either work or i think of home and then think about this you know i dont have to worry about you know um money um you know bills are getting paid and i can just concentrate on other things either you know do the things i like or mm you know maybe spending a little bit more time with my girlfriend or you know so something like that how do i what how do i cope with them um i just try not to think about it uh its its not about whether coping with it or not um i just do its uh im more of a guy that just you know it may take me a moment to to um say that im coping with something but you know it its if i have no control over it theres nothing that i can really do about it the only thing i can do is control to do what im doing and thats actively looking for work uh actively going out on uh interviews uh talking with others about work so that i can just kinda you know get back to um back to basics you know i just dont let a lot of stuff bother me it does bother me but i try not to to let it continue to bother me if what has gotten me in trouble my mood swing i mean um yeah money i mean you know my past i i got a past history so uh which kinda tends to uh uh bother my uh my hiring process i dont know if im gonna get hired so i gotta deal with uh different different type of employers who are uh say uh felony friendly and uh uh stuff like that and i try you know i ive taken classes on uh on uh how to interview how to uh how to answer some of the questions which you know come up quite a bit and uh i kinda reflect back on that but i just uh i gotta keep putting to my head that thats not who who i wanna be anymore so or you know i ive done uh ive done uh ive done my time uh so to say but uh i took the time you know the last time i just took a lot of time and and try to uh work on the issues that were bothering me so um you know toward positive stuff i got my ged different things a lot of classes um uh thought about going to school i didnt go to school and uh anything that would kinda um change my old ways and and uh and try to move on to more productive activities pardon me i still didnt hear you that people have been deceitful can you repeat that one more time alright uh ive been diagnosed with uh bipolarism um its tough if you dont you know um i dont medicate so i mean i have been on medication before in the past but sniff um again its i try to live on life uh i try to live life on lifes terms and i just you know um i know the medical establishments always wanna label something and and what i dont like about it is that they just experiment with pills you know ive been on probably every imaginable pill that there is for that and um you know some of them have been too strong or some of them not strong enough and so i just try to cope with things uh um its just my life skills you know i i dont i dont wanna be using drug i know certain drugs work for like three to four months six months and then they go well here im gonna try you on this and or im gonna try you on that and its just an ongoing process and i probably for about the last two years actually about three years i kinda just said you know what thats it and um whether its different than whether if i would be on on on uhon meds for it um i dont think so you know its the still the same stuff i still get the same problems and i still uh get the same anxiety as if i if i was on medication for it or not so i just and ill deal with it you know sometimes its not good you know i get irritated at people a lot i dont like people um i dont like crowds i dont you know like obnoxious people huge empty quiet so um but i i get a person you know i its not that personality but i think people can see me and just say uh dont mess with this guy or you know um but still you know i like i i ride public transportation quite a bit and um you know you just get a lot of loud obnoxious people on there sometimes i gotta get off the bus thats how i deal with with with with people because i just know theres consequences if i if i didnt deal with it that way so i just let it go id rather take the time on getting off the bus waiting for the next bus and hopefully its not that bad did i have a problem before i got out uh well i i dont know if i knew that i had a problem um uh before i found out the thing is that i know other people um i have a lot of ups and downs so i know a lot in my younger days people would tell me you know when i told them that i was diagnosed with you know bipolar that um a lot of remarks were like oh thats whats wrong you know thats what was wrong with you we we wish that you wouldve wouldve found that out years ago uh and uh like i dont think the meds really work but what i do uh i think uh time kinda like you know just getting older kind of uh you know makes it work you know me me dealing with life so pardon me uh i talked to a therapist probably on a weekly basis for a while uh recently and uh it helps a lot you know uh just to get out my anger uh my thoughts um a lot of people may not understand that but uh a therapist is i think the bigger thing is that i can just get it all out uh whatevers bothing me whether it be uh people you know uh uh other issues you know were whatever the case may be i just think talking about it and theyre such good listeners and can kinda like you know they they give me the same advice that you know that i you know give myself or whatever that i would give to others uh but its always helpful if you hear it from somebody else somebody who will be has a you know are are you know they go to school for this so you know but its good to have yeah well i dont go anymore uh so um i kinda miss it you know like i said uh uh i miss it a lot actually but uh its just one of those things you know i just deal with it you know uh according to you know if i ever get a chance to go to therapy again i probably will um well monetary reasons and uh you know uh i dont have health insurance theres a lot of things that you know id like to do but i cant you know um you know money situations not that great right now so how does my friends describe me um they would probably describe me as uh uh energetic uh outgoing person uh once i get to know people um laughs i you know i laugh a i laugh a lot um but uh they would probably tell you that im also very serious and uh uh hidden person i dont reveal a lot you know and uh so someone who has been a positive influence in my life someone whos been um someone whos been a positive influence in my life uh probably my boss one of my bosses uh when i first started with uh with exotic animals he was real you know he was uh uh german and um they didnt teach i dont know what he saw in me but he taught me a lot about working with exotic animals and um showed a lot of confidence in me and which in in it also built confidence in myself and uh sort of let me know that you know that theres nothing that i really cant accomplish if i put my mind to it you know yeah it was youre welcome bye laughter
