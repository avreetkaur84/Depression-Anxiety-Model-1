thank you mmm k im doing good thank you im from los angeles oh great i live in west los angeles the west side its alright i xxx no i live alone so i love it im from here so i grew up here its natural the weather um well the weather its always good its never its never bad uh um theres always something to do its rarely a dull moment the traffic the traffic is horrible well probably traffic is horrible in almost any major city but i hate the traffic not really i mean i have enough things going on here so if i travel its usually somewhere thats within driving distance i studied uh business i did no ive ive been done for a few years so i havent gone to school for a while one of these days ill go back to graduate school but my dream job would be to just work for myself and making lots of money um i dont know i dont really have a dream job just something that i can i can work under my own terms and get paid decently and and be in a creative creative environment um i dont know i think its just a matter of finding the right situation so right now eh its been people are a little conservative about what they want so and how they want it so its a little tougher than it seems se it should be but i dont know i think when the situations right i dont think its too difficult yep i work as an assistant as administrative assistant through a temp agency so its just basically i get sent out to do uh to do desk jobs um yes and no i mean i feel like i feel like i could do more but you know it works so you know yeah im pretty close i mean theyre around so um god really mad stupid people just basically doing just doing anything to annoy me um thats basically ba thats the big thing just just irritating stupid people laughter who just do things just to provoke provoke me for no reason at all um whats a good example just random people who who think its funny to just sit there and get a rise out of me just it doesnt have to be one any specific situation its just people who just think its funny to i think theyre just generally sadistic and they just think its its funny to to just prod you like its like poking a stick at an angry dog knowing that they know how to they just wanna push your buttons for no reason so uh god i dont remember i with those situations i usually try not to remember laughter when when it happens i just i just let it go and just like the past is the past i just tend not to look back what do you mean okay god what do i do to relax i like to run i like to go to the gym listen to music i have a lot of musician friends so i just so im usually around musicians so anything of that sort i like i like everything from punk rock art to tattoos to just anything thats thats generally art and creative whos been a positive pos i think its just friends in general who who seem to who seem to do well and i think they theyre very inspiring and which is sometimes a a bit tough in in a town like los angeles where i think everybodys on the go trying to accomplish their own goals so they dont its sometimes hard to find someone whos gonna be uplifting or try to be inspiring so i dont really have anybody in particular but people have kind of brought up things here and there you know just like hey instead of instead of doing this how about doing that or hey youre good at this why arent you doing that or something like that just you know im always looking for new opportunities so they always point out things that maybe i might i could do differently instead of just being negative saying hey dont do that thats no thats why are you doing that its a waste of time um i guess it depends on who you talk to im im okay at it i could probably work at that um i dont know i mean i can i i think i can do better at it well back to the point about people provoking me so i mean i try not to blow steam and let them get under my skin so i just usually try not to let it get to me but i dont know i guess with temper i guess it depends on how i handle my stress lately ive been better at it just because i think my situations been a little bit better no no no um nothing major i mean maybe when i was younger i couldve traveled more or i couldve worked towards something that paid better jobwise but i mean those are all things that i think at any point in life you always think like well i coulda shoulda wouldve done but you know but then again i think thats natural for anybody i mean i could i couldve become a banker or i couldve become a lawyer or a doctor and made about ten times the money that i make now but but then again i dont like the law and i dont like medicine so so im it wasnt meant to be so yeah so um i think i think my in my life i knew that i theres a lot of things i have ha theres more dislikes laughter than likes so i kinda narrowed it down to what am i good at and what am i not good at and what am i gonna work well or who who am i gonna work well with and who will i not work well with so i kind of i kinda sorted out and then the list kind of mmm kind of answered itself so no it i dont think it was hard but it was just but i think it was a real reality check and i think it its kind of a good thing cause sometimes trying to conform to doing things that doesnt really fit you doesnt make sense its like trying to shove a a round peg into a square a square hole and its like it just no matter how you try to shove it in its not gonna go in so sometimes its just might as well go down a path that seems to work better for you memorable experiences um hmm i think its just i dont really have like any one in particular i think i think every day is almost like a memorable experience whether its positive or negative i think its just everything from getting it just just the fact that i got a job and i can i can take care of myself is already almost like a memorable experience maybe for the average person it it sounds stupid but you know i think just the fact that im able im able to get this far in life without like completely selfdestructing is already an accomplishment so i feel like ive gotten somewhere maybe not to not maybe not to the point to the average person they might think like well why arent you a millionaire but you know what not everybody can be a millionaire yeah um when was the last time i really felt happy um i dont know im not really someone whos like i dont have any real high highs or low lows i mean i havent hit any lows so i mean i i dont know im usually pretty i feel like im a level person and im pretty happy ha every day i feel like if i accomplish one thing then im pretty happy so i guess to answer the question probably mmm probably yesterday i just feel like if i if im able to accomplish something then then hey im happy i dont know i dont really have a best friend but i mean i well to answer the question generally friends i think they would say that im very ver pretty outgoing im pretty determined im trying you know i try to you know i try to interact as much as possible im always out networking as much as possible so i dont know i guess thats basically what i think they would describe me as okay no problem alright bye
